Pneumonia Detection: Pushing the Boundaries of Human Ability with Deep Learning
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) That Detects Pneumonia From Chest X-Rays

Description of the Pneumonia Dataset
The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from patientsâ€™ routine clinical care. For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low-quality or unreadable scans. Two expert physicians then graded the diagnoses for the images before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, a third expert also checked the evaluation set.

Steps followed for the Python script to make the project.

Step 1: Data collection
Step 2: Data Exploration
